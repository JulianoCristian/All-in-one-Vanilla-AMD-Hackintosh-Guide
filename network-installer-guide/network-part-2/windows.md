description: 使用 MakeInstall.bat
---

# 從 Windows

1. 在 gibMacOS 資料夾中運行 MakeInstall.bat
2. A Command Prompt window should pop up. Your USB should be listed. Enter the number in front of your USB and press Enter.
3. It will format your USB. After that, shift + right click and copy the path of the downloaded macOS package `gibMacOS/macOS Downloads/publicrelease/xxx-xxxxx - xx.xx.x macOS xxxx/RecoveryHDMetaDmg(or RecoveryHDUpdate)`

    to the cmd window and press enter.

4. It will start to extract the resources and restore them to your USB drive. This will take some time depending your USB speed. Be patient \(again\)! If you have any error during this process, please go to this page for an alternative way.
5. After restoring the resources, the script will automatically install Clover \(boot-loader\) to your USB.
6. Go to this [page](../../clover-installtion/usb-clover/usb-clover-win.md) after finishing this part.
